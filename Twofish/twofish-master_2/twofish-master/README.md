Twofish Javascript
==================

In Spring 2000, I ported C implementations of Twofish and SHA-1 over to
Javascript as a way of password-protecting the contents of static web pages
(this was before I had done any server-side web programming). I never did
implement the general password mechanism I was initially planning on, but I did
get the encryption code working, and wrote a flexible test interface that can
encrypt and decrypt messages in
[twofish.html](https://russ.yanofsky.org/twofish/twofish.html).
